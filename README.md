#Challenge 1 - Intersection Observer
The design I wanted to accomplish required me to know where on the html document I was currently looking at/what the viewport is
showing me. I found out about Intersection Observer and quickly learned about it to reach my desired goal.

#Challenge 2 - Scope Variables
It was difficult to work with scopes - I kept wanting to use variables and access functions where it wasn't allowed. I had to experiment and research different ways to achieve the deisred outcome and learned a lot about scopes.
